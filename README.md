Developed a time series forecasting model to predict footfalls, enabling businesses to make informed decisions. Performed statistical analysis, checked for stationarity, and developed a forecasting model to predict future footfalls values. Conducted exploratory data analysis, checked for stationarity using the Dickey-Fuller test and rolling mean, and split data into training and testing set for model development and evaluation. Successfully developed and evaluated a time series forecasting model that accurately predicted future footfalls values, enabling informed strategic decisions.
